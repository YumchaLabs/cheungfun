# Machine Learning with Rust

Rust is increasingly being used for machine learning applications due to its 
performance characteristics and safety guarantees. While Python remains dominant
in ML research, Rust is finding its place in production ML systems.

## Why Rust for Machine Learning?

### Performance
- **Zero-cost abstractions**: No runtime overhead
