# Cheungfun RAG Framework

Cheungfun is a powerful Rust-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework.

## Key Features

- **Fast Embeddings**: Support for multiple embedding providers including FastEmbed, OpenAI, and Candle
- **Flexible Storage**: In-memory and persistent vector storage options
- **Advanced Retrieval**: Hybrid search, reranking, and caching capabilities
- **Production Ready**: Built with performance, reliability, and scalability in mind

## Getting Started

Cheungfun makes it easy to build RAG applications with just a few lines of code.
You can index documents, perform semantic search, and generate responses quickly.

## Use Cases

- Document Q&A systems
- Knowledge base search
- Code search engines
- Chatbots and virtual assistants
